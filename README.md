# New-Elite-101
This repository will have a Replit ChatBot of a Retail Store conversation created in Python.
#import random;
Generate some questions and responses to the user;
Return #random.choice(responses);
Create #def_init()
For user input, input a welcome or hello message to the user;
Create a #while loop to continue the conversation and a string character to end the conversation;
Add #if __name__ == "__main__":

## This part is for the newly added branch
I was successful in creating a new branch.
This branch will act as new branch in Replit and for my repository.
Let's add anything extra we want here.
